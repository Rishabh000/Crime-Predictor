# Crime-Predictor

This pproject presents a viable option of AI decision-making by raising questions about an individual's accountability in relation to criminal conduct. Automated Decision Making refers to the use of artificial intelligence and related technologies to assist or replace human decision-making in the criminal justice system. AI is already in practice to assist with tasks such as predicting recidivism, identifying suspects, or determining sentences. This project uses an Logistic Regression to predict whether a particular state/UT is at risk of increase in the crime rate or not.
